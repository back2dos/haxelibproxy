# haxelibproxy

Proxy for adding functionality to haxelib. This is just a basic project to get started.

Clone recursively. Then

```
haxelib newrepo
haxelib install foxhole
haxelib proxy localhost 8000 //press enter when asked for login
```

You're basically done. Anything laserunicorn related should be an indicator of how to take things from there.
